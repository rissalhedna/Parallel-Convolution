#Parallelizing Gaussian Blur

This project aims to optimize the performance of Gaussian blur, a widely utilized image filtering technique, by harnessing the power of parallel computing techniques like OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA C. Gaussian blur is notorious for its high computational demands, making it an excellent candidate for parallelization.

Through the parallelization of Gaussian blur using OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA C, this project showcases how the algorithm's computational bottleneck can be effectively addressed, resulting in accelerated and more efficient image filtering. The developed solution holds significant potential for enhancing real-time image processing applications, including computer vision, medical imaging, and graphics rendering, by enabling faster and more streamlined operations.
